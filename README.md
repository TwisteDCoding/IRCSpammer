# IRCSpammer
This is a test to see if the Twitch IRC protocol can be abused to spam individual channels.
For any member of twitch, r9k is a good idea in theory, however random characters, as seen in this script can bypass it, a more effective way is to limit users per IP address to connect to the main irc server.
